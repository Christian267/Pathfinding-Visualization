1. X Update the visuals of the project (css/html)
2. X Fix with the bug where animation keeps playing when clearGrid() is called
3. Add new algorithms to visualize (A star, breadth first, depth first etc)
4. X Add placeable weights into the grid
5. X Look into behavior of grid when no path to finishNode is avaiable. It doesn't break anything but looks a little odd.
6. X Fix bug (FIXED BUT IDK WHY. PLACED clearGrid() and placeWalls() IN A SETTIMEOUT BLOCK IDK WHY IT WORKS)
    > Visualize algorithm with walls in place
    > Place new wall after visualization is complete
    > New walls are ignored by the subsequent visualization
    So far found that
    # Putting a 1s delay on placeWalls in the visualizeDijkstra() method  
7. X Make start and end nodes draggable
8. X Automatically re-render pathfinding when start and end nodes are dragged
9. X BUG; Visualize Algorithm after dragging endpoints incomplete animation.
10. X Make endpoints not able to go into walls
11. X (Actually just fixed the BUG that made me want to restrict) Make start and finish nodes not able to be placed adjacent to each other.
12. Make a premade maze button.
13. drag on empty grid keep grid empty.
